					<h3>About Rubbie Kelvin</h3>
					<p>
						Rubbie Kelvin is a young and inspiring, Nigerian
						self-taught full stack developer, recognized for his
						groundbreaking innovations and ouside-the-box problem-
						solving strategies. His extensive expertise in
						technological concepts has enabled him to contribute
						meaningfully to society, by consistently creating useful
						products and offering guidance to aspiring tech
						professionals.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rubbie's passion for technology was ignited in his
						teenage years, when a team of robotics engineers visited
						his high school to prompt and encourage the students to
						explore careers in tech. Prior to this event, he was a
						naturally-gifted artist who enjoyed drawing and dreamed
						of owning his own comic bookstore. However, after his
						encounter with the robotics engineers, his focus shifted
						more toward robotics. He immersed himself in science
						books and was briefly mentored by his math teacher. In a
						short while following this, he built his first robot
						car, made with paper. Not long after, he left robotics
						in pursuit of skills in software development.From that
						point forward, he has prospered within this discipline,
						forging a distinguished professional path. Overtime, he
						has pioneered and led teams, earning the respect of both
						beginners and experts owing to his excellent work ethic.
						He has also made significant contributions to numerous
						open-source projects and has partnered with other
						engineers to create high-impact solutions.
					</p>
					<p>
						The journey and success story of this young, astute
						software engineer, inspires many. Those who know him
						personally often attest to his warmth and unwavering
						willingness to help others in need, in any way that he
						is able to.
